# PROJECT 1: Visualizations using Matplotib, Seaborn and Folium
This project focuses on analyzing historical automobile sales data to understand how economic recessions impact different vehicle types, pricing strategies, advertising expenditures, and consumer behavior. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn where applicable), the project explores key trends and patterns in sales performance during recession periods compared to normal economic conditions.

### What Was Done?
Data Preparation & Cleaning<br>Filtered recession vs. non-recession periods<br>Grouped and aggregated sales data by vehicle type, year, and month

### Visualization & Analysis
Sales Trends: Compared how different vehicle types (luxury, family, sports) performed during recessions.<br>Economic Factors: Analyzed the impact of GDP, unemployment, and consumer confidence on sales.<br>Pricing & Advertising: Examined how pricing strategies and ad spending changed during downturns.

Seasonal Effects: Identified high and low sales months during recessions.

### Key Findings
Luxury vehicles (Sports/Executive) were more recession-resistant.<br>Family cars (Medium/Small) saw significant sales drops during downturns.<br>Higher unemployment led to steeper declines in sales for budget vehicles.<br>Advertising spending shifted during recessions, with some brands cutting budgets while others maintained them.

### Deliverables
Multiple interactive charts (line plots, bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots).<br>Insightful conclusions on recession impacts on the auto industry.<br>Business recommendations for pricing, marketing, and inventory strategies.

### Why This Matters
This analysis helps automotive companies:

✔ Optimize pricing & promotions during economic downturns.<br>✔ Adjust inventory based on demand shifts.<br>✔ Improve ad spending efficiency in recession periods.

By leveraging data-driven insights, businesses can make smarter decisions to navigate economic challenges effectively.
